# Administration manual : TicTacToe

## Softwares you will need:

You will need a Git to be able to write commands to install and run TicTacToe.<br/>
You can download the latest version for desired operating system here [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

You will need Node.js package manager. You ncan get the latest version of Node.js here [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) package manager.

Javascript is an interpreted language, not a compiled one such as Java or C#. So for today's exercise there is no need to setup any
compiler, but to manage dependencies that we will use (additional libraries) we will use NPM (https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node
(https://nodejs.org/en/) package manager). In addition to install NPM (https://www.npmjs.com/), Node (https://nodejs.org/en/) also gives us
a Javascript runtime, so we can run our code outside of a browser.

Our application is hosted as an open repository on github.com. <br/>
You can access it here : https://github.com/TheDropouts

In order to deploy and run our application you need to download nodejs to your computer.<br/>
You can find it here : [nodejs](https://www.npmjs.com/)

If you are using your terminal/console can clone the repository to your computer by running 
the native git command _git clone_ <br/>
Like this : git clone https://github.com/TheDropouts/TicTacToe <br/>
Or you can use https://github.com/TheDropouts/TicTacToe and download a zipfile 
containing the application.

The game is also deployed as an Web-App. <br/>
Which you can access here : https://the-dropouts.herokuapp.com/

To be able to deploy and run our application you need to install npm to your terminal/console.<br/>
You need to be located in the folder you have downloaded the game into.<br/>
