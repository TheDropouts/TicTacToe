# TicTacToe

The Game
Tic Tac Toe is a two player game. The first player plays with X figure and the second player plays with O figure. 
Player X always starts the game. The game board is a grid of squares 3x3. 
Players take turns to mark empty squares with their figures. The goal is to get 3 squares marked in a row. 
Figures can be marked horizontally, vertically and diagonally. The player that first gets 3 squares marked in a row wins the game. 
If all 9 squares are marked without any of the players getting 3 squares marked in a row, the game ends in a tie. 
In order to start a new game, press the “reset” button.
